Instructions in the comments.

You'll need Tensorflow 2. I installed it with the command

  `pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-beta0`
  
On OSX it'll run slow as TF doesn't support GPUs on OSX.
It does use multiple cores though, if you have them.

On Linux with an nvidia GPU it should be fast.

I think you can run TF on Windows.
